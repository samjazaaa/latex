						\end{itemize}
					\item Safe Languages
						\begin{itemize}
							\item Cyclone: static and dynamic checks, avoidsoverflow and format string
							\item CCured (source-source translator): static + dynamic, need library wrappers

							\item Watchdog Processor: program derived from cf-graph or function-graph
							\item Uses signatures (e.g. start address) for each node
							\item Embedded (ESM) vs. autonomous (ASM) Signature Monitoring
							\item ESM: signatures stored between basic blocks and transfered while execution
							\item ASM: signatures stored in watchdog, cfg mapped to control program
						\end{itemize}
					\item ASM approach
						\begin{itemize}
							\item Needed: current pc, next pc, correct jump targets + sources
							\item direct jumps: source + target, indirect: only source, interrupts: only target
							\item Control Flow Method (CF): basic blocks as nodes

				\end{itemize}
			\item Exploiting cryptographic weaknesses
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Too small keys can be cracked by brute force (e.g. DES)
					\item Wrong cryptographic design (WEP)
					\item Stream cipher simulates one-time pad by generating a keystream
					\item WEP: 40 bit (easy) vs. 104 bit (no bruteforce) keysize
					\item Wireless: Frames get lost and PRNG restarted for each frame
					\item Small key size because of 24 bits IV (also reused)
				\end{itemize}
			\item Copying
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Copying of sensitive data, e.g. Intellectual Property (IP)
					\item Confidentiality compromised
					\item Copying of Programs / IP Cores is easy
					\item Register Transfer Level (hdl), Logic Level (netlist), Ciruit Level (bitfile)
				\end{itemize}
			\item Overview of countermeasures
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Social protection (law, copyrigth)
					\item Reactive protection (no prevention but detection)
					\item Active protection (physical / crypto, highest deterrent degree)
					\item Social protection sometimes hard for smaller companies
				\end{itemize}
			\item Encryption (active)
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Instructions stored encrypted
					\item Decrypt during fetch (HW) or while loading into memory
					\item Goals: prevent unauthorized use or modification
					\item Encrypted HDL / netlists: design tools decrypt before usage
						\begin{itemize}
							\item Problem: different EDA tools must enrypt result again
							\item Protection of EDA tools against read-out attacks
							\item No industrial standard for encrypted IP core
							\item Keyhandling
								\begin{itemize}
									\item Symmetric (AES): tools must know different vendor keys; if one key is 
										cracked, all connected cores lose protection
									\item Asymmetric: keys enrypted with EDAs public key; seperate versions for each 
										tool, much time
									\item Hybrid: cores encrypted symmetric, key encrypted with EDA pub key
								\end{itemize}
							\item Disadvantages
								\begin{itemize}
									\item Fixed constraints, restricted choice of tools
									\item slower simulation, no re-use of cores
								\end{itemize}
						\end{itemize}
					\item Encryption of FPGA file: bitstream decrypted inside the FPGA
						\begin{itemize}
							\item Bitfile stored in non-volatile memory (PROM) and tranferred encrypted
							\item FPGA decrypts with a hard core before configuring
							\item Key storage
								\begin{itemize}
									\item Volatile: low power SRAM with external battery (more comlicated attack, 
										but more space and cost)
									\item Non-Volatile: flash / EEPROM, no ext. device but needs latest CMOS with 
										increased costs
								\end{itemize}
							\item Key Management
								\begin{itemize}
									\item Embedded Key: FPGA loads enc. bitfile from PROM and decrypts it at power on
									\item Encrypted Partial Bitfiles: decryption done by a statically loaded soft 
										core
								\end{itemize}
						\end{itemize}
				\end{itemize}
			\item Unique Identification of the Execution Site (active)
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Software / IP Core checks ID of board
					\item Only executes or loads if ID is correct
					\item Identification through USB Dongle, MAC or TPM
					\item TPM: endorsement key in persistent memory can bind software to host
					\item FPGA identification through external device, unique embedded key or physical unclonable function (PUF)
					\item CPLD can store board key and crypto for challenge-response auth.
					\item Unique keys (device DNA) in FPGAs
					\item PUFs
						\begin{itemize}
							\item Returns unique value, extracted by physical properties
							\item Silicon PUFs use manufacturing related delay variations
							\item Categories
								\begin{itemize} 
									\item Ring oscillator: edge detection and counter
									\item Arbiter: challenge vector is road through multiplexers, clock registers 
										data bit 
									\item RAM: during power up SRAM cells create pattern which can be used
								\end{itemize}
						\end{itemize}
				\end{itemize}
			\item Watermarking (reactive)
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Multimedia watermarking alters data slightly
					\item IP watermarking must no alter user data (functionality)
					\item Fingerprint is a watermark that is individual for each copy
					\item Attacks
						\begin{itemize}
							\item Ambiguity attack: multiple watermarks in design
							\item Removal attack
							\item Copy attack: copying work without permission
							\item Key copy attack: exchange watermark (signature)
						\end{itemize}
					\item Should be functional correct, easily verifiable, difficult to remove
					\item Additive vs. constraint-based
					\item Can be used for HDL, netlists, bitfiles
					\item Additive
						\begin{itemize}
							\item Not embedded into functionality but can be masked
							\item HDL: difficult because its human readable, stored in unused space or sent during testmodes
							\item Bitfile: encoded into unused LUTs, location can be used as fingerprint, number of LUTs in 
								2x2 tile or stored in unused multiplexers
							\item Can be removed by searching for unusual connections
						\end{itemize}
					\item Constraint-based
						\begin{itemize}
							\item Optimization constraints characterize set of feasible solutions
							\item Additional constraints for the syntheses tool as watermark
							\item HDL: exploit scan chain, for DSP alter the result slightly
							\item Netlists: restrict number of used inputs of LUTs, rewiring through redundant nets
							\item Bitfile: placement (odd / even rows), routing, timing (split paths)
							\item Layouts: number of vias and bends, size of repeaters
						\end{itemize}
					\item Constraints only work as is (not on another level, embedded or re-routed) and can be ambiguous
				\end{itemize}
			\item Watermark verification
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Temperature watermark (up to 15 minutes to verify)
					\item Netlist identification
						\begin{itemize}
							\item Extraction of LUT content and checking if its a subset
							\item Problem: further optimization might change LUT contents
							\item Solution: Prevent optimization by e.g. converting LUTs into shift registers
						\end{itemize}
					\item Power Watermarking (netlist level)
						\begin{itemize}
							\item Measuring power consumption of the FPGA
							\item Watermark ist produced by additional consumer (e.g. shift register)
							\item Two shift registers: one for signature, (large) one as consumer
							\item If curr. signature bit is 1, the large one gets shifted
							\item Different Encoding Methods: basic, enhanced robustness, BPSK, correlation
							\item Transfer rate up to 500 kbit/s
							\item Signatures can also be multiplexed
						\end{itemize}
				\end{itemize}

		\end{itemize}

	\section{Non invasive physical attacks}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Overview
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Eavesdropping: gathering sensitive information
					\item Solution: (proper) Encryption
					\item Side-Channel Attacks: attacker has control over power and clock lines
					\item Active (inducing faults) vs. passive (only observe)
				\end{itemize}
			\item Timing Side-Channel Attacks
				\begin{itemize}
					\item E.g. strcmp execution time depends on number of matching chars
					\item Measuring the longest execution time reveals the right digits
					\item Software Data-Dependencies: no conditional branches that depend on secret data
					\item DDs in Hardware: hardware (functional units or caches) can cause DDs
					\item DDs of Functional Units
						\begin{itemize}
							\item Mostly in multiplication and division
							\item Some use early termination depending on size of source
							\item Div terminates earlier if dividend and divisor are similar size
							\item Conditional branches take different amount of cycles
							\item Load/Store take two for the first access then one for each additional
						\end{itemize}
					\item DDs caused by the cache
						\begin{itemize}
							\item Two consecutive lookups take less time if the same address is accessed
							\item This can be used to gather secret information
						\end{itemize}
				\end{itemize}
			\item Timing Attack on simple AES
				\begin{itemize}
					\item SubBytes usually implemented using lookup tables $\Rightarrow$ timing attack
					\item MixColumns performs additional xor if MSB was set before shift $\Rightarrow$ timing attack
					\item Attack Setting
						\begin{itemize}
							\item AES encrypts $D$ random data blocks
							\item Attacker knows plaintexts and is able to observe overall timing for each encrypt
							\item Each byte: xor with key, s-box, multiplied inside MixColumn
							\item Depending on MSB of s-box output the encryption takes 1 cycle longer or not
							\item Generate s-box bytes for every data-byte xor key-byte combination
							\item For each key candidate calculate avg. 1 and 0 time and select the one with biggest diff.
						\end{itemize}
				\end{itemize}
			\item Power Side-Channel Attacks
				\begin{itemize}
					\item CMOS consists of PMOS (low) and NMOS (high)
					\item Gates consist of pull-up (PMOS) and pull-down (NMOS)
					\item Leakage current is data-dependent
					\item Short circuit current: when input switches both networks are conductive for a short time
					\item Charging current: When output switches capacitance needs to be charged, leading to a higher data-dependent 
						current
					\item Setup needs a clock generator, measurement circuit and osciloscope
					\item Measurement throught small resistor, current probe or electromagnetic probes
					\item First step is to find interesting parts by visual inspection of the power trace
					\item Attacker learns operation-dependent power consumption and thus sequence of instructions
					\item Gross changes in power profile: cache hit/miss, memory access, peripherals (e.g. coprocessors)
					\item Detection of repeated patterns and variations
					\item Differential Power analysis on AES
						\begin{itemize}
							\item Measuring power consumption based on AES output
							\item Each 1000 trace where MSB of byte 1 of cypher is 1 / 0
							\item Calculate mean and difference between these values
							\item Very effective against block ciphers like AES
							\item Power consumption depends on intermediate values of crypto algs.
							\item For every time instance and every key hyp. calculate difference between high and low means
							\item Result is matrix of size \#hyps * length of trace
							\item Only at the right time with right hyp. greater power differences are observable 
								(max of matrix)
						\end{itemize}
					\item Countermeasures
						\begin{itemize}
							\item Switch key frequently (protocol level countermeasure)
							\item Make power consumption independent of intermediate values (random or equal for each cycle)
						\end{itemize}
					\item Hiding
						\begin{itemize}
							\item Same calculations but reduction of data-dependent power consumption
							\item Lowering signal-to-noise ratio (adding noise) increases number of needed measurements
							\item Random delays add propability p of executing a command at a certain time; measurements 
								increase with square of p
							\item Choice of instructions, noise engines, dual-rail pre-charge
						\end{itemize}
					\item Masking
						\begin{itemize}
							\item Randomize intermediate values so the attacker cant exploit the leakage
							\item Typically values are xored with random mask
							\item Masked software / hardware implementation, masked logic styles
						\end{itemize}
				\end{itemize}
			\item Fault Analysis
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Inducing faults through temperature, frequency, supply voltage, ...
					\item Spike / Glitch Attacks: disturb power supply or I/O lines
					\item Light Attacks: switching transistors with light; local with lasers or global
					\item Countermeasure approaches: sensor-based (detect induction) vs. error-detection 
					\item If attacker can precisely set bits he can set every key bit to 0 and check new result
					\item Fault Attacks on AES
						\begin{itemize}
							\item Changing input of AddRoundKey with different fault models
								\begin{enumerate}
									\item attacker can toggle bits $\Rightarrow$ no info
									\item set certain bits to certain values $\Rightarrow$ yes
									\item set bits to unknown values $\Rightarrow$ no info
								\end{enumerate}
							\item Same for input of ShiftRows
							\item Attacking input of SubByte with fault model 1 is possible
								\begin{itemize}
									\item Able to toggle LSB of s-box input
									\item Generate pairs of correct and faulty encryptions for each plaintext
									\item Check for all possible keybytes for which the s-box input only differs 
										in the lsb
								\end{itemize}
						\end{itemize}
				\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}

					\item Software provider: Trojans / Viruses
					\item Workshop staff: inserting unsupported modules (tuning), obfuscate faults
					\item Constitutional State: Provide Logs to identify guilty parties
					\item Unknown third party: disclosure of sensitive data, stealing car, assault on occupants
				\end{itemize}
			\item Gateways
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Physical: On Board Diagnostic, USB / Memory Card, wiring (mirrors)
					\item Non-physical: wireless interface, software update, appstores
				\end{itemize}
			\item Attacks on Communication Networks
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Physical: Disconnecting / eavesdropping of cables
					\item Protocol Attacks: inserting / modifying / logging of bus messages, DOS
					\item Network Topology Attack: creating new gateways by modifying ECUs that are connected to multiple buses, 
						bypassing security functions
				\end{itemize}
			\item Protection against Code-Injection
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Additional return stack in hw / sw
					\item Address obfuscation and software encryption
					\item Secure programming languages
					\item Static / dynamic code analyzer
					\item Anomaly detection
					\item Compiler / Library / OS Extensions
				\end{itemize}
			\item Security Zones
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Subdividing network in different zones with different trustworthiness
					\item A Bus can only be assigned to a single zone
					\item Encrypted channels and tunnels across bus boundaries
					\item Highest rust zone uses encryption, authentication and secure gateways
				\end{itemize}
			\item Physical protection
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Make trustworthy networks hard to reach
					\item Switch of bus segment if manipulation is detected
					\item Implementation as System-on-Chip
					\item Destruction of ECUs when opened
				\end{itemize}
			\item ECU authentication through (double) challenge-response
			\item Authorization rules for each ECU (ignoring non authorized messages)
			\item Intrusion detection
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Network protocol: additional nodes analyze traffic
					\item Physical: measurement instruments
					\item Deny access to sensitive data, disconnect bus segments, issue warning
				\end{itemize}
			\item Conservation of attacks evidence through Event Data Recorders (EDR)
		\end{itemize}
